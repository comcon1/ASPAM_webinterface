*** SERVER & LIBDAQ CONFIGURATION HELP ***

Three configuration files should be generated and edited to make the program work properly:

  -) server.conf (at server home directory)
  
  -) parameters.conf (at server home directory)

  -) current.mplstyle (at dqpackage.libDQimage directory)

1. SERVER.CONF

  All configuration of SERVER.CONF can be copied from SERVER.CONF.EXAMPLE file. Note that 
<tools.staticdir.dir> parameter commonly should be equal to <root.workingDir> of PARAMETERS.CONF.
If <tools.auth_digest.on> is set to *True* then htdigest file should be create in the same directory.
The following strings should be inserted into htdigest:

username:realm:HA1_hash_string

  The *realm* string should be equal to <tools.auth_digest.realm> parameter. *HA1_hash_string* can be 
calculated as MD5 digest of the following string "username:realm:password". REALM parameter is not KEY
parameter! The htdigest file should be located at DQSROOTDIR variable defined in *config.py*.

  Modify <server.*> parameters as it is pointed in the documentation of CherryPy 3.8.x and higher to 
adopt WSGI server behavior.

2. PARAMETERS.CONF
  All configuration of PARAMETERS.CONF can be copied from PARAMETERS.CONF.EXAMPLE file. The main parameters
are explained below:


 root.turnsonmeters   - coefficient of converting wheel turns into meters (the length of wheel circle)

 curves.r<N>.color    - color of rat no. N (as it display at experiment review panel)

 download.legendwidth - width of the legend on downloaded images (in inches)

 default.experiment.daystart
                    morning
                    evening - parameters of understanding daynight and daylight time periods. Daystart is time
that corresponds to the start of the whole day. morning - is the time of daylight period starts, evening - time 
of daynight period starts. All parameters are in HH:MM format.

3. CURRENT.MPLSTYLE

  This is matplotlib style file that can be modified according to your wishes.
